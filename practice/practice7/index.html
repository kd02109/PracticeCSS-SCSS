                <h3>Rodić Davidson: London Architecture</h3>
                <span>Our Bloomsbury based practice has been working in central London since 2006. Having worked within the oldest areas of London, we have developed an expertise in historic buildings. These are often Listed and situated within a Conservation Area. Our knowledge and experience consistently secure Planning Consents, Listed Building Consents and Great Estate Licenses.</span>
                <span>Many areas within central London boroughs were originally developed by aristocratic families (examples being Grosvenor, Cadogan, De Walden, Portman and Bedford), and these family estates still own large swathes of, what is now commonly referred to as, Prime Central London. These Great Estates maintain significant influence either through direct ownership or through various stewardship schemes, an example being the Belgrave Estate Management Scheme administered by Grosvenor. Schemes such as this enable the Estate to exert control over the use, development, and appearance of the designated area.</span>
                <span>We have a growing body of new-build work in Prime Central London and elsewhere the UK.  Through sensitive, contextual design and iterative dialogue with Clients and Planners, Rodić Davidson have established a track record of obtaining difficult planning consents for both new-build and existing properties.</span>
